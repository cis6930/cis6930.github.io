Our data is acquired from NCBI. It is Illumina sequencing of Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 via random selection by Illumina Genome Analyzer II. It is paired layout and used for studying genome sequencing with short reads. Escherichia coli MG 1655 was one of the selected microbial genomes which had a finished reference sequence available. At least two libraries including short fragment and jumping were generated and sequenced using illumine. Also,454 sequencing were generated and run in particular for E.coli.
