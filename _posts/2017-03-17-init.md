Implementation and evaluation of an efﬁcient dynamic data structure for DeBruijn graphs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The de Bruijn graph is a data structure which plays an important role in
second-generation sequencing applications, which tend to yield a large
number of short sequence fragments . It
was first introduced by for de novo assembly
of DNA sequences. 

<b>To get a De Bruijn graph, one should:</b>

  1.choose an appropriate value k.

  2.For each k-mer that exists in any sequence create an edge with one vertex labed as the prefix and one vertex labeled as the suffix.

  3.Glue all vertices that have the same label.

>Given an alphabet set Σ of σ symbols and a set of sequencesS := {S1,S2,...,St}, the de Bruijn graph of order k onS is deﬁned as follows. Let Mk denote the sets of k-mers (sequence of length k)thatoccurassubsequenceinSi forsomei.Adirectedgraphwithvertex set Mk is created, with directed edge e connecting node s ∈ Mk to node r ∈ Mk ifandonlythereexistsasubsequenceofsomeSi oflengthk+1 with s as a preﬁx and r as a sufﬁx. 

However, De Bruijn graph has it own <b>problems in practice</b>
