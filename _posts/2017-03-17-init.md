Implementation and evaluation of an efÔ¨Åcient dynamic data structure for DeBruijn graphs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The de Bruijn graph is a data structure which plays an important role in
second-generation sequencing applications, which tend to yield a large
number of short sequence fragments . It
was first introduced by for de novo assembly
of DNA sequences. 

To get a De Bruijn graph, one should:

  1.choose an appropriate value k.

  2.For each k-mer that exists in any sequence create an edge with one vertex labed as the prefix and one vertex labeled as the suffix.

  3.Glue all vertices that have the same label.
