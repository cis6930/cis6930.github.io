The de Bruijn graph is a data structure which plays an important role in
second-generation sequencing applications, which tend to yield a large
number of short sequence fragments (Conway and Bromage, 2011). It
was first introduced by Idury and Waterman (1995) for de novo assembly
of DNA sequences. Given an alphabet set Σ of σ symbols and a set of
sequences S := {S1, S2, ..., St}, the de Bruijn graph of order k on S is
defined as follows. Let Mk denote the sets of k-mers (sequence of length
k) that occur as subsequence in Si for some i. A directed graph with vertex
set Mk is created, with directed edge e connecting node s ∈ Mk to node
r ∈ Mk if and only there exists a subsequence of some Si of length k + 1
with s as a prefix and r as a suffix
